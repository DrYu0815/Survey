# Comprehensive Reviews into Function Calling in Large Language Models

A systematic review of techniques, challenges, and solutions for function calling in Large Language Models (LLMs). This repository indexes research on:
- **Function calling mechanisms**: How LLMs parse user queries to invoke external functions
- **Deployment strategies**: Methods to implement efficient function calling systems
- **Evaluation frameworks**: Metrics and benchmarks for assessing function calling capabilities

Reproducibility is important! We prioritize methods with open-source implementations when possible.
