### Critical Emphasis

![Experimental results showing performance trends across models of different sizes, demonstrating that larger models achieve significantly better function calling capabilities after fine-tuning.](./figures/model_size_comparison.jpg)

Based on practical implementations, we emphasize that data quality (and variety) plays a more crucial role than data quantity in both data construction and fine-tuning phases, given the intricate nature of function calling tasks.

![Performance comparison across different model sizes, showing that larger models demonstrate substantially better function calling capabilities after fine-tuning, while base models show minimal function calling abilities regardless of scale.](./figures/model_comparison_q.jpg)

Based on practical implementations, we emphasize that data quality (and variety) plays a more crucial role than data quantity in both data construction and fine-tuning phases, given the intricate nature of function calling tasks.


| Emphasis | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Data Quality | Prioritizing dataset diversity and verification over quantity for more robust function calling capabilities |
| Model Scaling | Larger models demonstrate significantly better function calling capabilities, with notable improvements above 7B parameters |
| Capability Balance | Maintaining a balance between specialized function calling abilities and general language capabilities to avoid performance tradeoffs |

### Function Mapping



![Figure 7: Function mapping strategies in LLM function calling, illustrating the transformation process from natural language input to system-executable function calls through pronoun mapping, format alignment, and error checking.](./figures/functionmapping.jpg)

Function mapping plays a crucial role in deploying function calling, primarily responsible for transforming model outputs at the semantic level into executable commands in the physical space. Moreover, as shown in figure, function mapping involves Pronoun Mapping, Format Alignment, and Error Checking.
