# Comprehensive Reviews into Function Calling in Large Language Models

An index of algorithms and methodologies for:
* function calling: enhancing LLMs with external system interaction capabilities
* function execution: managing the execution process and response generation
* tools and frameworks: implementing function calling in practical applications

Reproducibility is important!
We will highlight open-source implementations and frameworks where available.
